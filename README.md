## Currently
I was student at Ivy Tech Community College, pursuing an Associate of Science degree in Cyber-Security & Information Assurance. 
But due to some life events, college has been put to a halt for the time being, things have happened, causing a domino effect... thus currently stoping me from attending school, however like mark tain said it... " Never let schooling get in the way of your education... " with that being said, as I was more or less self-educated to begin with, haveing not been to school sinc I was 15 only to start college in my thirties, I have learned much.. And will continu to do so, with or without institutions of learning.
