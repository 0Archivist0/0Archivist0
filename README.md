Still behind but the file "operation catchup' within the 'My scripts' repo it has the scipts nade from "having to catch up" and as I'm still stuck doing so, that file will continue to grow... Been using AI to help write code, scripts, and or the pre-cursers to other programs.. 
Ive also used a few other peices of software to aid in keeping my mind and other things in order.( or at least attemting to lol)
who knows what else will wind up in it.. or on this pages... 
probably not the best spot to write these things, but oh well...

As of now I'm not sure where life is going for me, 
I'm a college student at ivy-tech pursuing a Associates of science in cybersecurity and information assurance...

I'm more or less self educated, as I just started college as a 32 year old and haven't been to school since I was 15. 

I come from an industrial background with nearly a decade of factory and foundry experience, attempting to change careers from the dead factory and foundry life, to a career in I.T. as computer science is a hobby that I would like to change into a career...
