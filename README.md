# Hello, my name is Kris..

Im a small buisness owner learning computers and software... But learning dont pay the bills so I picked up sub-contracting in construction and remodeling because the decade in factorys translates over, so learning two things at once..

My buisness is called Archivists Endeavors. The reason for why I named it that is because Archivists are responsible for appraising, preserving, and redistributing knowledge and information... The Endeavors is how the the information and knowladge was aquired...

Iâ€™m interested in the ins and outs of linux and computers/software in general, Im all over the place with it but I enjoy learning it.. I come from a Industrial background and finally couldn't take being expendable and replaceable anymore.. Ive always had an intrest in computers and a friend of mine got me into linux.. One thing after another and here I am typing to a screen at 3:40 in the morning... 

I just started my first year in school.. im going for cybersecurity (08/22)

This is my personal Profile and Repositories...

not much else to say to the world of the internet and the people of git...except dont give up... keep trying... the most that will happen is you fail...and if you fail, you learned somthing new.
Godspeed everyone
