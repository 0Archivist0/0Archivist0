## Nothing really special to see here....
Used to be a student, or may currently be, I don't know at this point as things in life has gotton real complicated.
But as of 05-19-23 I know That the college is going to terminate me, so !@#$ em then.. I passed the classes but With the divorce, loosing everything, and now, well It doesnt matter anyways.. No reason to explpain anything I really don't care anymore...
So I guess I'll find out more as I go along in life, Or not... 
Either way.. Im just to dahm tired of life.. so I may add stuff, I may be gone for good, I know it doesnt matter in the long run... like me....  And Ive grown tired of this race... I'm Just so Dahm tired...

## To be continued...... Maybe
