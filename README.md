## Currently
I am hitting a rough patch in life, but that doesn't stop me :)
As of now I am doing freelance I.T. work, while also trying to sow together the tattered peices of my life.. 
While doing that I have been doing some basic R&D experimenting more with AI, Diffrent kinds of software and hardware.. utilizing what I have on hand. I have this unique ability to throw things together and make them work.. making older computers and machines live again in this modern day world by finding unorthodox ways to do so at times. 
I Plan on doing some more projects, getting older ones done, finished or just archived to mmake room for the new ones.


## Remember
### A tool is only as good as its user, and it is the responsibility of the user to determine its purpose and impact.
