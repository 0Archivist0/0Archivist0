# My name is Kris Tomplait
### I am an owner of a small business called "Archivists Endeavors." 

#### (You can find more information about the business at https://github.com/Archivists-Endeavors.)

## Currently
I am a student at Ivy Tech Community College, pursuing an Associate of Science degree in Cyber-Security & Information Assurance. I am deeply fascinated by technology and have a strong passion for learning. While my academic focus is on cyber-security, I am also enthusiastic about computer science as a whole.

## Why Cyber-Security
One of the reasons I chose to pursue a Degree in cyber-security is because it is one of the few fields where my past experiences are not only forgiven but also considered beneficial. In the past, I was involved in activities as a threat actor, which gives me a unique perspective on the threat landscape. I can think like a criminal, because I used to be one.
This perspective allows me to approach cyber-security challenges from a different angle.
However, my love for technology extends beyond cyber-security. While there may be certain aspects of technology that I don't particularly enjoy, I believe that the benefits it brings far outweigh any drawbacks. Additionally, I recognize the value of free and open-source software tools, although I am aware that their usage can have both positive and negative impacts.

## Remember
### A tool is only as good as its user, and it is the responsibility of the user to determine its purpose and impact.

## My choice
Given my background and experiences, I have made a conscious choice to utilize my knowledge and skills to benefit and assist others. I am committed to the pursuit of knowledge for the betterment of mankind. My GitHub profile will serve as one of many platforms for me to share and contribute to the world, by education ( as in knowladge not schooling, as mark twain said it "never let schooling get in the way of your education") and  uses of technology.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me.
