# Name is Kris...
I am a college student goin after a AAS in cybersecurity... 
Before that I was self educated... Mark Twain  had two phrases that summed up what I thought of schooling...
" Never let schooling get in the way of your education " &  " The More I start to understand people , the more I love my dog""
          Or somthing like that........
